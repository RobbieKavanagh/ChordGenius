# ðŸŽ¸ChordGenius

### Overview
Welcome to ChordGenius! ChordGenius started out as a guitar tuner. But going through this project my coach Gillian and I decided it would be much better used as a tool to help people learn basic chords for guitar. The concept is that you pick up your guitar, click on the Chord and play along with the corrosponding chord with the attached diagram.

### Purpose
The purpose of ChordGenius is to help anyone pick up a guitar and learn basic guitar chords.

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡
I've been passionate about music my whole life. I started playing guitar when I was about 16. I think this would be something simple enough for anyone to pick up a guitar and learn some basic chords.
