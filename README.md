# ðŸŽ¸TuneGenius

### Overview
Welcome to TuneGenius! TuneGenius is a guitar tuner for standard tuning(E,A,D,G,B,E). It will play the sound that the corresponding string should sound like. You strum along until your string sounds the same as TuneGenius!

### Purpose
The purpose of TuneGenius is to keep your guitar in tune from day to day. Just open the site and tune along. Then you can go and play whatever music you are into!

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡
I've been passionate about music my whole life. I started playing guitar when I was about 16. I was always misplacing my tuner. So I decided to make this to be able to use a tuner online.
